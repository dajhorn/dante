# Assuming de0 is on the lan-net, the below will make connections to it
# (and anything else on the lan), be direct, i.e. not go via the proxy.
#route { from: 0.0.0.0/0 to: de0 via: direct }

# Clients going anywhere else go via the proxy server listening at
# IP address 10.1.1.1, port 1080.  Uncomment the line(s)
# corresponding to the proxy protocols your proxy server supports.
#route {
#        from: 0.0.0.0/0   to: 0.0.0.0/0   via: 10.1.1.1 port = 1080
#        proxyprotocol: socks_v5         # server supports socks v5.
#        proxyprotocol: socks_v4         # server supports socks v4.
#        proxyprotocol: http             # server supports http.
