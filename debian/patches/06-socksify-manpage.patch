+.SH NAME
+socksify \- dynamically SOCKSifies a program
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+.B socksify
+.I program
+[
+.I arguments
+]
+
+.SH "DESCRIPTION"
+.B socksify
+is Dante's equivalent of the NEC SOCKS'
+.BR runsocks .
+sockisfy uses
+.B LD_PRELOAD
+environment variable to wrap all networking-related system calls 
+so that programs can go thought a SOCKS server that was installed as part of
+a firewall.
+.SH "SEE ALSO"
+.\" Always quote multiple words for .SH
+.BR dante.conf(5)
+.SH NOTES
+A more permanent solution would be to add the 
+.I LD_PRELOAD
+environment
+value to the shell startup files.  Then all non-set[ug]id applications
+that are linked dynamically would be socksified.  However this can have bad
+side-effects.
+.SH AUTHOR
+Dante was developed for Inferno Nettverk A/S, Norway by:
+ - Michael Shuldman <michaels@inet.no>: Design and implementation.
+ - Karl-André Skevik <karls@inet.no>: Autoconf and porting.
