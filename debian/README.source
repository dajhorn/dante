The dante package uses quilt to maintain local changes to
the dante distribution.  The Debian-specific patches are maintained
in the debian/patches/ directory.

To apply all the patches, preparing the source for building, use:
  debian/rules patch

To revert the patches, preparing to build a source package, use:
  debian/rules unpatch

You do not need to manually execute these targets when building
the package; they are part of the debian/rules target chain.

For more information on the quilt integration with Debian packages,
as well as editing, adding or removing patches, please see
the quilt documentation; in recent versions of the Debian package of
quilt, start at the /usr/share/doc/quilt/README.source file.
